This repository is part of the academic course - Numerical-Analysis in SCE - Shamoon College of Engineering.

The repo contains an implementation of methods that will be learned within the course to solve numerical analysis problems. Each method has an explanation in a PDF file and a runnable example to assist in understanding and applying these methods.
